This is an exercise from LeWagon's FullStack Bootcamp

This is a Food Delivery program for a Restaurant.

The software is designed for **one restaurant only** (e.g. it only has one `Restaurant` model).

The main components are:

- **Employees** (managers, delivery guys)
- **Customers** of the Restaurant
- **Meals** that can be ordered
- **Orders** made by customers, and assigned to a given delivery guy.

Since the Employees Modules hold different "roles" for different Employees, the program
has a log_in feature and that is the main reason it was saved here, in TODAY-I-LEARNED.

SessionsController is commonly used controller, and this program was saved to be used later
as a template to build other such controllers in the future.
