These are meant to be used as a valuable database with important and common features on developer's coding world.
# TODAY-I-LEARNED

This is a #CRUD project on important gems acquired along the path of becoming a better fullstack developer.

## Reason to be

Many great features can be collected when one is learning something new, all good coding camps offer coding examples that are really hand-to-hand to the daily reality of companies.
Having a repository to store and update them, when new concepts are learned or with a handy smarter friend, allow to have a handy library of relevant content ready to be used as frameworks to code day-to-day solutions.

### Prerequisites

Commitment.
The project uses a Today-I-learned concept where one is constantly trying to apply the freshly learned concept to real problems out there, and when one of them pops up as a potential cool feature, commitment to save it here comes up.


```
One example is the first feature stored in this library-project. SessionsController, a MVC that builds up the log_in and log_out feature.
```

## Running the tests

It is important to only save working features to avoid problems in the future. Fine if its mechanics could be refined along the way with better unit testing, that is the whole point of it! Improving and saving to be used later!
Just make sure it is properly WORKING before you save it here.
